# NCPE-Ireland-Drug-Exploratory-Analysis-and-Data-Cleaning
NCPE ireland drug data is scraped from http://www.ncpe.ie/ for the year 2018-2019. The Scraped data is stored on MySql database.  

Data cleaning is done using regex python package to avoid NULL values, irrelevant, duplicate entries and incomplete data. 

Exploratory data analysis(EDA) is done to understand drugs that are specific to Ireland, given for rapid reviews per year before coming to the market for actual use, types of drugs sent for rapid review, manufactures that submitted the most number of drugs for NCPE approval, total drugs for immnunization along with the list.

All the above EDA are shown by various types of python libraries such as altair, matplotlib and seaborn.
